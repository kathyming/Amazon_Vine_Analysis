## Summary
After reivewing the data, there is a negligible bias amongst the paid reviewers versus the non-paid reviewers (59% vs 54%).  However, given the very small dataset of piad reviewers these results are in-conclusive.  A dataset that included a larger number of paid reviewers would be necessary to determine if there was actually a bias.
